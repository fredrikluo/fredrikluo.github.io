Try to catch up with chromium code which I haven't touched for many years.

What has been done:
* Checked out the code
* Compiled and ran it on Mac

What to do:
* What's the best way to debug it, it seems to be very slow. How do I deal with multi process problem.

To use it on server side, it seems like we need to solve those problems:

** Too much memory:
* Remove the unecessary parts
- NP plugins
- Videos ( keep the url but no need to download or render the video)
- WebRTC 
* Render into a display list instead of a real picture.
* Customise the V8 engine to save memory?

** Solve the SPA page problem:
* Is rendering the SPA just the matter for mapping the content of a json to different places on the page?

** To remove the boiler plate:
* analyze the pages from the same website to remove all the unecessary parts
* analyze the pages from time to get the update and index them
* train for specific pages, e.g.  e-commerce, news, comments
